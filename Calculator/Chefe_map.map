Mapping design into LUTs...
Running directed packing...
Running delay-based LUT packing...
Running related packing...
ERROR:Pack:198 - NCD was not produced. All logic was removed from design.  This
   is usually due to having no input or output PAD connections in the design and
   no nets or symbols marked as 'SAVE'.  You can either add PADs or 'SAVE'
   attributes to the design, or run 'map -u' to disable logic trimming in the
   mapper.

Mapping completed.
See MAP report file "Chefe_map.mrp" for details.
