------------------

Section 2 - Warnings
--------------------
WARNING:LIT:176 - Clock buffer is designated to drive clock loads. BUFG symbol
   "clko_BUFGP/BUFG" (output signal=clko_BUFGP) has a mix of clock and non-clock
   loads. The non-clock loads are:
   Pin CE of bina_3
   Pin CE of bina_0
   Pin CE of bina_1
   Pin CE of bina_2

Section 3 - Informational
-------------------------
INFO:LIT:95 - All of the external outputs in this design are using slew rate
   limited output drivers. The delay on speed critical outputs can be
   dramatically reduced by designating them as fast outputs in the schematic.
INFO:MapLib:562 - No environment variables are currently set.

To enable printing of redundant blocks removed and signals merged, set the
detailed map report option and rerun map.
